shFlags 1.0.x README
====================

code.google.com
===============

This project is stored on code.google.com as http://code.google.com/p/shflags/.
Documentation is available there, as are all releases and source code. The
source code is stored in Subversion and can be accessed using the following
information.

Browse the code in a web browser:

- http://code.google.com/p/shflags/source/browse
- svn > trunk > source > 1.0

Check out the code locally ::

  $ svn checkout http://shflags.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ shflags-read-only

Documentation is available on the web at
http://code.google.com/p/shflags/wiki/Documentation10x.


Making a release
================

For these steps, it is assumed we are working with release 1.0.0.

Steps:

- write release notes
- update version
- finish changelog
- check all the code in
- tag the release
- export the release
- create tarball
- md5sum the tarball and sign with gpg
- update website
- post to code.google.com and Freshmeat

Write Release Notes
-------------------

This should be pretty self explainatory. Use one of the release notes from a
previous release as an example.

Update Version
--------------

Edit ``src/shflags`` and change the version number in the ``FLAGS_VERSION``
variable.

Finish Documentation
--------------------

Make sure that any remaning changes get put into the ``CHANGES-X.X.txt`` file.

Finish writing the ``RELEASE_NOTES-X.X.X.txt``. Once it is finished, run it
through the **fmt** command to make it pretty. (This assumes the lines weren't
already wrapped at 80 chars when the file was edited.) ::

  $ fmt -w 80 RELEASE_NOTES-2.0.0.txt >RELEASE_NOTES-2.0.0.txt.new
  $ mv RELEASE_NOTES-2.0.0.txt.new RELEASE_NOTES-2.0.0.txt

We want to have an up-to-date version of the documentation in the release, so
we'd better build it. ::

  $ pwd
  .../shflags/source/1.0
  $ rst2html --stylesheet-path=doc/rst2html.css README.txt >README.html

Check In All the Code
---------------------

This step is pretty self-explainatory ::

  $ pwd
  .../shflags/source/1.0
  $ svn ci -m "finalizing 1.0.0 release"

Tag the Release
---------------
::

  $ cd ..
  $ pwd
  .../shflags/source
  $ ls
  1.0
  $ svn cp -m "Release 1.0.0" 1.0 https://shflags.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.0.0

Export the Release
------------------
::

  $ cd ../builds
  $ pwd
  .../shflags/builds
  $ svn export https://shflags.googlecode.com/svn/tags/1.0.0 shflags-1.0.0

Create the tarball
------------------
::

  $ tar cfz ../releases/shflags-1.0.0.tgz shflags-1.0.0

Sign the tarball with gpg
-------------------------
::

  $ cd ../releases
  $ gpg --default-key kate.ward@forestent.com --detach-sign shflags-1.0.0.tgz

Post the release
----------------

To post the release, the ProjectInfo page needs to be updated with the release
info (release, date, and MD5), and the release with GPG signature needs to
uploaded.

Post to the Web
---------------

- http://shflags.googlecode.com/
- http://freshmeat.net/
